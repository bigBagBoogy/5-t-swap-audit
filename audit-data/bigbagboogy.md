Note: switching to '7d<***   commit   hash   ***   k>6'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

`git switch -c <new-branch-name>`

# salt

In blockchain smart contracts, "salt" typically refers to a random value that is used to enhance the security of certain cryptographic operations, especially in the context of creating unique hash values. One common use of salt is in the process of hashing passwords to prevent rainbow table attacks.

A rainbow table attack is a type of precomputed attack on password hashes. It's a method used by attackers to crack hashed passwords more efficiently than traditional brute-force attacks. The concept involves creating a large table (the "rainbow table") that contains precomputed hash values for a vast number of possible plaintext inputs, such as passwords. The idea is to look up the hash of the target password in the table to find the corresponding plaintext password.

Here's a simplified overview of how `rainbow table attacks` work:

Hashing and Reduction Functions: The attacker starts by creating a table of precomputed hash values. This table is generated by applying a cryptographic hash function repeatedly, often using a series of reduction functions to create new inputs for subsequent hash operations.

Chain Generation: The attacker creates chains of hashed values by repeatedly applying the hash and reduction functions. Each chain starts with a randomly chosen plaintext value.

Table Storage: The endpoint of each chain (the final hash in the sequence) is stored in the rainbow table, along with the starting plaintext value.

Attack: When the attacker obtains a hashed password (e.g., from a compromised database), they can look up the hash in the rainbow table. If a match is found, the corresponding plaintext from the chain is the password.

# Proof of Code

### reading from storage to show that private variables are not private

1. Run Anvil chain
2. Use the contract addres:
   run: `cast storage 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3`

output:
| Name | Type | Slot | Offset | Bytes | Value | Hex Value | Contract |
|------------|---------|------|--------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| s_owner | address | 0 | 0 | 20 | 1390849295786071768276380950238675083608645509734 | 0x000000000000000000000000f39fd6e51aad88f6f4ce6ab8827279cfffb92266 | src/PasswordStore.sol:PasswordStore |
| s_password | string | 1 | 0 | 32 | 49516443757395204518384437876896412918898210405993719258753982441762571943956 | 0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014 | src/PasswordStore.sol:PasswordStore |

### _or run:_

cast storage 0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3 1 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545
to target storage slot 1 specifically. This gives output:
0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014
This is the hex representation of the stored password.

To decode this, run in CLI:
`cast parse-bytes32-string 0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014`

output: _myPassword_

# DoS 
Look for "for loops" where the "thing" that is iterated over, is not "bounded"
It it is not bounded to a particular size, can a user just add an arbitrarily 
amount of items to that list.
How much does it cost the user to do that?
If a user can do that and add a nearly infinite amount of things to that list
very cheaply, then you might have a critical or high vulnerability

Look for external calls (a call from the protocol to an external contact (wallet contract))
and see how this cal may fail. If you'd have a liquidate function that sends a remainder
of funds to the liquidated user, but the user ha set his contract/wallet up to NOT
receive crypto, the liquidate function will revert, preventing the liquidation.

### External function calls may fail if:

#1 Sending ether to a contract that does not accept it
#2 Calling a function that does not exist
#3 The external call execution runs out of gas
#4 Third-party contract is simply malicious


# Reentracy

CEI is not always a clear opening to a reentracy attack.

I found there is a distinct difference in the mechanics of `transfer` and/or `call`

```javascript
    function withdrawBalance() public {
        uint256 balance = userBalance[msg.sender];
      // using transfer:
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(balance);
          // State change
        userBalance[msg.sender] -= balance;    
    }

 ```
### using `call` will be more vulnerable it seems:

```javascript
    function withdrawBalance() public {
        uint256 balance = userBalance[msg.sender];
        (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: balance}("");
        if (!success) {
            revert();
        }
        // State change
        userBalance[msg.sender] = 0;
    }
```

## ```.transfer``` vs ```call``` vs ```.sendValue```
## .transfer Method:

- The .transfer method is a higher-level convenience function in Solidity for sending Ether. It is commonly used for simple Ether transfers and is meant to be a safer alternative to direct send calls.
- It is specifically designed for sending Ether and includes a limited amount of gas (2,300 gas) to prevent reentrant attacks by limiting the gas available for the recipient to execute arbitrary code.

### while .transfer provides some level of protection by limiting the gas available for external calls, it doesn't eliminate all reentrancy vulnerabilities.

## call method:

- The call method is a more flexible and lower-level way to make external function calls, including sending Ether. It allows you to specify the amount of gas to be sent along with the call.
- When using call to send Ether, you have greater control over the gas parameters, and you can specify a custom gas limit for the execution of the recipient's code.
This flexibility allows for more advanced use cases and is often used when interacting with contracts that may have specific gas requirements.

## sendValue method:
 Very similar to `.transfer`. The most notable difference is that .sendValue returns a boolean value indicating the success or failure of the Ether transfer. This return value can be used to handle failure scenarios more explicitly.
 example:
 ```javascript
bool success = Address.sendValue(payable(msg.sender), amount);
require(success, "Ether transfer failed");
```

# Athrimatic errors

Example of overflow: `uint64 collectedFees` How much until this overflows?
to find out you can do:  `chisel`
`type(uint64).max`
output:      Decimal: 18446744073709551615
this is 18e18, so 19 eth will overflow!
18000000000000000000

# mishandling of ETH
```javascript
        require(address(this).balance == uint256(totalFees), "PuppyRaffle: There are currently players active!");
```
This type of strict requires will make the protocol vunerable to DoS / mishandling of Eth
If someone forces eth into this contract using `selfDestruct` then
```address(this).balance !== uint256(totalFees)``` and you won't be able to withdraw.

### sushi swap mishandling of msg.value:
https://samczsun.com/two-rights-might-make-a-wrong/

The below function from the sushi swap proltocol, allows for executing multiple
(auction) handlings/biddings, but within this function, msg.value is persisted.
Meaning one could but his 1 eth at multiple objects at once.

```javascript
function batch(bytes[] calldata calls, bool revertOnFail) external payable returns (bool[] memory successes, bytes[] memory results) {
        successes = new bool[](calls.length);
        results = new bytes[](calls.length);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < calls.length; i++) {
            (bool success, bytes memory result) = address(this).delegatecall(calls[i]);
            require(success || !revertOnFail, _getRevertMsg(result));
            successes[i] = success;
            results[i] = result;
        }
    }
```
# Slither INFO:Detectors:

PuppyRaffle.withdrawFees() (src/PuppyRaffle.sol#159-165) sends eth to arbitrary user
        Dangerous calls:
        - (success) = feeAddress.call{value: feesToWithdraw}() (src/PuppyRaffle.sol#163)
Reference: https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#functions-that-send-ether-to-arbitrary-destinations

Above message I saw also in competitive audit of "The Standard".
The combination with an unprotected `set` function can be critical.

### Exploit Scenario:
```javascript
contract ArbitrarySendEth{
    address destination;
    function setDestination(){
        destination = msg.sender;
    }

    function withdraw() public{
        destination.transfer(this.balance);
    }
}
```
In the case of `PuppyRaffle::changeFeeAddress` it has `onlyOwner` so it should be fine.
Don't overlook that appart from the owner also the _constructor_ can set the feeAddress. 
This might be an issue in proxy contracts that initialize wrong. 
think: _"I think I killed it"_


# gas

When using `something.length` in a loop, we're actually reading from storage every time.
This can be very gas expensive if the array is big.
In this case you better cache this:

```javascript
  function getActivePlayerIndex(address player) external view returns (uint256) {
   uint256 playerLength = players.length; // read from storage once
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < playerLength; i++) {
            if (players[i] == player) {
                return i;
            }
 ```
